Order of Execution
-------------------

> Loads the original record from the database

> Overwrites the old values with new values

1) If request is from a standard UI Page
   - Check for layout specific rules, valid field format, max field length, field definition.

2) If request is from a custom source
   - check for foreign keys.

(If Multiline items are created, only then custom validation rules are run.)

> Execute before record triggered flows

> Execute all before triggers
(Run System and Custom Validation Rules)

> Execute Duplicate Rules
(If record is a duplicate, no more execution, block the data entry)

> save record to database, do not commit yet

> Execute all after triggers

> Execute assignment & auto response rules

> Execute workflow rules
(if there a field update, run system validation, execute before and after update trigger one more time)

> Execute escalation rules

> Execute Processes and flows
(No Granteed order of execution)

> Execute Record Triggered flows after record save

> Execute Entitlement rules

> If record contains Roll up/Cross object reference, parent is updated
(same with the grandparent record too and so on)

> Execute criteria based sharing

> commit to database

> Execute Post commit logic
