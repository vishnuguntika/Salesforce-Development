Salesforce follows the MVC Architecture.

Database Layer - Model - Underlying Database represented by sObjects.

User Interface Layer - View - The front end or the UI represented by the VF, Aura, LWC

Business Logic Layer - Controller - Actions or event handlers written using javascript or automation tools.


Salesforce groups customers into what is called an instance.

Instances are also called Point of Deployment (PODS).
This PODS contains everything an org needs to run.

POD has the database, file system, and application server.

each customer or businees need to have only one pod.


what is an org?

An org is the customer version of salesforce.

As multiple customers share a common instance and databse, every org is uniquely identified by  an org id.
